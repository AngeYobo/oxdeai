 * guard.cas.test.ts
 *
 * Regression tests for the compare-and-set (CAS) state persistence protocol
 * at the reusable PEP boundary (issue #36).
 *
 * Protocol requirements:
 *   - getState() returns { state, version }
 *   - setState(nextState, expectedVersion) returns true on success,
 *     false on version mismatch (concurrent modification)
 *   - The guard throws OxDeAIConflictError and blocks execution on false
 *   - The CAS commit happens BEFORE execute() — a mismatch has no side effects
 *   - Missing version from the store is fail-closed (OxDeAIAuthorizationError)
 *
 * Test IDs: CAS-1 through CAS-6.
 *
 *   CAS-1  Matching version → execution allowed, setState called with correct version
 *   CAS-2  Concurrent write advances version between read and commit → OxDeAIConflictError, execute not called
 *   CAS-3  Concurrent double-execution simulation → second call denied via CAS
 *   CAS-4  Missing version from store → OxDeAIAuthorizationError (fail-closed)
 *   CAS-5  CAS failure: engine's nextState not committed, beforeExecute and execute never called
 *   CAS-6  Determinism: identical inputs produce identical outcomes across independent guard instances
